# Zipline

A story by Rich Bowen

## Launch

It's all about the launch, because, after that, it's all gravity and
angle of descent.

g times sin θ

g is 1.622 m/s². θ varies from one part of the course to another, but
there's nothing you can do about that.

Minus friction, of course, but The Corporation always claimed zero
friction. And while we all know that's not possible, that's the story
they're sticking to. And there's no wind resistance to speak of outside
of the airlock, so that only really matters for a few minutes of the
ride. Still, I'm wearing a skin-tight suit, and a tear-drop shaped
helmet, complete with the heads-up display with all of the stats.

But, really, the only thing you can control is the launch.

The numbers tick down in my HUD, and I tense, ready for the launch.

... 2 ... 

All my opponents are listed at 0.00. Zero point zero zero seconds ahead,
or behind me. Time elapsed, zero.

I can't see any of them from here - we all launch from widely separated
spots so there's no chance of interference. Our paths will converge
later on.

... 1 ...

I strain against the rail lock ready for ...

Launch

With a crack, the rail lock releases, and I am plunging towards the
edge, just twenty meters away.

Nine months of training compressed into about 2 and a half seconds. I've
run this race thousands of times. Every stride has been rehearsed, every
footfall and pushoff optimized so that I'll be going as fast as possible
at the edge, and so that the last step is as close to the edge as
possible.

And I push off the edge.

Freefall for less than a second,

and then, the cables take up the slack, and I'm riding the rail, and
my work is almost done.

I point the teardrop of the helmet directly down-path, and hold my arms
hard against my sides, and point my toes. I hardly dare to breathe, in
case it causes more drag.

Ahead, the airlocks approach. A series of four irising openings that
open in front of me, and close behind me. Or, so I assume - I'm not
about to look back and lose precious microseconds.

The first one doesn't seem to change much, because it's full of air from
the colony, but as I pass into the second, still gaining speed, it's
noticeably quieter - less air rushing past my helmet, less buffetting of
my shoulders. And by the third, it's almost silent.

The fourth passes, and I'm completely outside, flying far above the
surface, steadily picking up speed.

I close my eyes tightly, and mumble "HUD off".

I don't want to see the numbers, since there's nothing I can do about
them.

"Turn off head-up display?", the not-quite-human voice in my earphones
asks.

"Yes."

I open my eyes, and see darkness below, the brilliant stars above, and
the blinking green lights of my opponents to the left and right of me.

Nothing now but to wait.

I adjust the tension straps of my suit, so that I'll keep this
aerodynamic pose without cramping every muscle in my body. Not that it
matters out here. There's practically no atmosphere to speak of, in
spite of a century of effort.

## Atmosphere

Growing up, I loved - no, worshiped - Ray Bradbury. I read, re-read, and
memorized the Martian Chronicles. It was practically gospel to me.

Except Benjamin Driscoll and his trek across the wilderness planting
trees.

Benjamin Driscoll notwithstanding, planting trees in alien soil is a
difficult business. The picture of a wave of pure cold oxygen sweeping
across the Martian landscape was a myth. A compelling myth, to be sure,
but a myth.

Generations of terraformers had planted trees on the dusty lunar surface.
Seeds, saplings, and full adult trees. Only a few stands of scraggly
baobabs stood witness to all this effort. They were apparently the only
thing hardy enough to endure the long lunar nights, or extract any
nourishment from the hostile soil, in spite of billions of dollars worth
of effort, and constant nurturing.

And so the waves of crisp cold oxygen were not forthcoming, and it was
still mostly a vacuum out here, between the domes. Vacuum, and lots and
lots of nothing. 

While most of the domes have been producing most of
their own food for decades now, everything else had to come up from 'The
Planet', as we call it here. This is, of course, something that we're
continually aware of, and everything that's uniquely moonie, we are
pretty proud of.

Like the zipline.

## Numbers

When I can't stand it any longer, I relent. 

"HUD on."

The numbers spring up again. We'd been riding a whole three minutes.

For each of the 9 of us, the screen shows velocity and lead
time. We're still very early, so velocity is still fairly low, and
varies only a tiny amount from one to the next.

Even though the numbers are right there in front of me, I quickly do the
math in my head. g sin θ. I check the mechanical slopemeter mounted
beneath the rail trolley next to me. About 15 degrees incline. Sine of
15 is .65, as any fan of rail riding memorizes in their childhood.

Acceleration equals g sin θ.

That gives an acceleration of about 1.055 meters per second per second.

v = a * t ... velocity is acceleration multiplied by time ... that's 180
seconds, for a total of about 190 meters per second ... plus whatever my
initial velocity was, which was apparently right around 10 meters per
second, 'cause I'm going just a hair over 200 m/s now.

I learned in high school that terminal velocity - the speed at which
acceleration due to Earth's gravity matches air resistance - is about 56
m/s. With no atmosphere to speak of, terminal velocity is a lot higher.

One rider - number 8 - is way behind the rest of us, with a trailing
time of almost 3 seconds. Must have stumbled on the launch. The rest of
us are in a tight pack. #3 and #7 are ahead of me. .024 and .017,
respectively. The rest are behind by similar margins.

Better than I had hoped for at this point. Plenty of time to make that
up in the domes. New Chicago first, then Bradbury.

## Zipline

It was called the Richard Branson Memorial Slideway, named after the
greatest civilian astronaut of all time. But everyone called it the
Zipline.

My great grandfather claimed to have met Sir Richard. It was a story he
told at every family gathering, without fail.

"You know, once I met Sir Richard," he'd begin.

"You did not, you old coot," G G Ma would cut him off. "You weren't even
born yet!"

Great grandfather would give me a big exaggerated wink. I had no idea
what that meant.

The first time he told the story, I looked up what 'Coot' meant. A coot,
the article said, was "a medium-sized water bird that is a member of the
Rallidae (rail) family." What more proof did I need? Great grandfather
was clearly a rail rider, and, so, ipso facto, must have actually met
Sir Richard. Q E friken D, as my big brother would have said.

When I explained my theory to him, he just rolled his eyes at me.

Years later, I realized that it was just a story that Great grandfather
told to irritate G G Ma.

Years later still, I realized that it was just part of the game that
they played, because they were so in love, and had these games they
played. All. The. Time.

It's weird how kids so seldom understand the adults in their lives, even
the ones that they're the closest to.

(For what it's worth, he did, in fact, meet Sir Richard, sort of. But
that's a story for another time.)

They'd built the zipline in the early days of the dot.moon
financial bubble. In those days, everybody knew - just KNEW -
that the moon was going to be the next big thing. Everybody was going to
make a killing. And so they invested trillions of dollars in every
harebrained scheme that sounded even remotely feasible, and a lot that
didn't.

The zipline was one of the latter - a gravity-driven rail to join the
main settlements, most of which hadn't been built yet. It would be used
to deliver supplies between the domes. This, of course, made no sense at
all, because each dome had a landing platform, and, with the low
gravity, it was a pretty low-cost thing to move supplies from one place
to another.

But, armed with a glossy brochure, a big smile, and a memorable name,
Thaddeus Q Alkina extracted over two hundred billion dollars from
bamboozled investors, and began to ferry huge steel girders from his
factories in Detroit to start building the Richard Branson Memorial
Slideway.

Of course, he promptly went bankrupt, but not before almost all of the
building material had been delivered. And there it sat, shiny and
stubbornly unrusting in the arid moon atmosphere, for more than 20 years.

The steel workers that had been ferried up to the moon to work on this
absurdity, now out of work, cobbled together a zipline of sorts between
the few pillars that had been erected before the inevitable financial
crash. Incredibly unsafe, consisting of little more than steel cables
strung from one pillar to the next, it provided them with some
distraction in their years of idleness intermixed with odd jobs and
government subsidy.

My great grandfather was one of those workers, and began to make
something of a name for himself in the races. While most of his stories
he told again and again, as far back as I can remember, this one he only
told a few times, when I was older, and he was ... much older.

The ziplines back on Earth, he told me, consisted of little more than a
pulley - called the trolley - that rode on the cable. You clipped into
it from your body harness, and you rode the line down to the ground.

Things were a little more complicated here. For one thing, with no
atmosphere, you needed to carry some air along with you. So the trolley
became a bit more elaborate. Great grandfather had built the first rail
rider, from parts that he had found discarded various places.

He called it the Red Barchetta.

"Because," he said, "I built it from parts I found on my uncle's country
place, that no-one knew about."

"Did he claim it used to be a farm?" G G Ma piped up?

Half the time, I had no idea what those two were talking about.

The Red Barchetta was an aerodynamic shuttle that would set the tone for
all of the rail riders to follow. It carried the air you'd need to ride
from one dome to the next, and a few extra bells and whistles that Great
Grandfather kept a closely guarded secret.

After a few of the other guys had copied his design, there would have
friendly races down the bits of rail that they'd put together.

And, as men will do, they started to wager a few dollars on the outcome.

That was when Johnson Barbados saw the opportunity for making some real
money, and started building his empire.

## To Hell and Back

After the initial spread of the launch, the rails began to converge, and
I saw my opponents getting ever closer. We were all very slowly picking
up speed. Low gravity doesn't mean no gravity, and we were being
accelerated at a steady g sin θ, with θ hanging right around 15 degrees.
That comes to about 1.05 m/s². Doesn't seem like much to you Earthies,
I'm sure - a misperception that has killed an awful lot of you. Terminal
velocity is a lot faster on the Moon than it is on Earth, what with no
air resistance to speak of, and it takes longer to get to it, but once
you're there, it's just as terminal. Pun intended.

And so we were slowly creeping up from our original speed, at the rate
of about one meter per second every second.

[[TODO: Need to do some math here ]]

There's a few reasons that the rails converge. The obvious one is cost
savings. With the rails together, you don't need as many support
pillars. One massive pillar can easily support the puny weight of the 9
racers.

But the other reason is the audience. The closer the tracks are, the
more opportunities to manufacture drama for the audience. Tracks
crossing, twirling around each other close enough for the riders to
reach out and touch. Not that they ever would, and risk sacrificing
precious momentum. And there was always some amazingly coincidental
story about some of the riders. Estranged family members. Former lovers.
Sworn rivals. Something. It was usually pretty contrived, but it made
for good television. It was all about the advertising.

## New Chicago

If there's anything you can count on, when people move to a new place
to get away from the old one, it's that they'll name the new after the
old, and recreate all the things they hated about the old, right there
in the new.

So it was with New Chicago. They left behind the dirt, the corruption, the
class inequality, and came to the moon to recreate it, dirtier, more
corrupt, and with even greater inequality. Although all possessions were
left on Earth, so that everyone arrived on an equal footing, a class
system was quickly established, with all of the injustice and
exploitation they'd had before. More, indeed, because they were making
up the rules from scratch, and they didn't have to rely on ancient
definitions of justice or fairness.

They believed firmly on one man, one vote. And that man's name was
Barbados. Johnson Barbados. He had nothing in old Chicago, but when he
arrived in New Chicago, he set about creating what he imagined success
should look like.

He started small, by buying beer for all of the guys that worked the
loading dock, and rerouting some of the supplies -- the rare luxury 
items -- to his stores. 

He avoided prosecution by asserting that Earth
laws didn't exactly apply here on the moon. The judges, many of whom had
a taste for fine whisky, opined that it was a very important precedent,
for future sovereign colonies, that the moon didn't blindly bow to every
arbitrary ruling from Earth. Such as that Barbados was a menace and
should be locked up, for example.

## Momentum

P = mv

That is, Momentum = mass times velocity.

Mr. Sheikh hammered this into us in physics class, his Mumbai accent
inexplicably preserved, despite three generations on the moon.

"P equals m wee, vich means that ..."

"Uh, Mr. Sheikh," interrupted Charles Nnebe, the big kid of Nigerian
extraction, who had the imppecable accent of a high-class moonie, "What
is 'wee'?"

"I'm not saying wee, I'm saying wee!"

"Right, uh, Mr. Sheikh, that's what I asked, sir. What's wee?"

"Wee, you impertinent boy. Wee, not wee! Welocity!"

So, although m doesn't matter in terms of acceleration, in a
theoretically frictionless environment, in actual reality it's pretty
important. m is why it's harder to stop a train than a paper airplane
going at the same speed.

## Finish Line

## Commerce

"We're out!" screamed the tall man, practically foaming. His tie, so
immaculate in the TV photo ops, was pulled down and to one side, and his
eyes were red with rage.

"Out. No more double-platinum sponsorship. No more shuttles to the moon
for your pretty boys. No more TV campaign. No more. Done."

Sitting at the huge mahogany desk, Mr. Barbados appeared unperturbed. He ran
his fingers lovingly over the smooth surface of the desk, remembering
that it had cost more to bring it to the moon than this worm had paid
for the TV spots in the latest race.

A single desk lamp shone on the desk surface, reflecting dully up into
his large face, the bushy eyebrows leaving his eyes hidden. He pushed a
few folder around, and let the sponsor fume for just a moment longer.

Still, he was an important sponsor. Better make a show of caring.

"Please, calm yourself, Larry. Nobody could have predicted. And look at
the coverage." He gestured to the screen, where the moment was being
played back for the millionth time. "The movie rights alone ..."

"We paid to win, not for some sappy greeting card photo finish. She
LOST. She's no champion. She lost. We're out!"

He turned, flung the door open so hard that the knob embedded in the
wall, and stormed out, leaving a trail of open-mouthed assistants,
secretaries, and the late-night cleanup crew who had just arrived,
staring after him.

Mr. Barbados sat quietly for a moment. He briefly made eye contact with one of
the hovering assistants, who closed the door. With the snick of the hasp,
the room was restored to quiet, nothing but the tick of the ancient
clock - it, too, worth more than the puny sponsor so recently departed -
breaking the silence.

He took a deep breath, exhaled softly.

Then

"As planned. Are you in for next year, then?"

A shadow emerged from the shadows.

"As planned? How could you possibly know?" The look on his face was
admiring, but also a little frightened.

"Are you in, or not? The opportunity will not arise again."

Mr. Barbados picked up a folder from his desk, and held it over the waste paper
basket, raising his eyebrows ever so slightly as he glanced up at the
thin man, standing in the gloom.

"Oh, yes, of course, we're in. As agreed. Of course. No, we wouldn't
think of backing out." The look of panic was unfeigned, his many
investors seemed to be peering over his shoulders.

"Excellent."

The folder was placed back on the desk, and Mr. Barbados went back to perusing
some papers, as though he was alone again.

Several minutes later, the thin man cleared his throat. "Uh ... sir
...?"

Mr. Barbados looked up.

"You're still here." A statement, not a question, but with an implied
threat as cold as midnight on the moon.

"No. No sir."

He slipped into the hallway, leaving the gears of commerce to tick
softly in the darkness.
