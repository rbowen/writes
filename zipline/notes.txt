Zipline

1. Launch
2. Zipline
3. New Chicago
    Failed colony city. Commentary on the stupid name - and that it's not new after all:

    If there's anything you can count on, when people move to a new place to get away from the old one, it's that they'll name the new after the old, and recreate all the things they hated about the old, right there in the new.

4. Momentum
5. Sabotage

    Corporate sponsorship
    Friction? Sand on rail? Coptor drones?

6. Finish line
7. Conspiracy


What is gravity on the moon. Air density? Teraforming?

Bradbury's "Johnny Appleseed" stories notwithstanding, planting trees in

Helene (Pronounced like the French)

Helena Troy ("I'm sorry, I only brought the one ship.")


Red Barchetta (Because parts of it came from my uncle's place, that
no-one knew about. Didn't he claim it used to be a farm?)
The barchetta is a bit of a legend among zipline fans - won 5 races -
and nobody knows I have it. Lots of riders ("Driver, son!") mod their
canopy to look like the Bachetta, so I got away with having the actual
one.
