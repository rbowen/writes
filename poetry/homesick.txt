Homesick
26-May-2007

I am homesick, heartsick, and weary,
beaten down by the consequences
of choices I made when I wasn't paying attention.
I left my home, and chose another one, where I could
never feel at home.
As I now approach home once more,
the pain and loss are all the more painful,
as I look back to what was left, what was lost,
and think that maybe, maybe, had I been paying attention,
I would never have left.
