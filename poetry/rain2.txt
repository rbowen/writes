Rain in Paris
19-Jun-2007

It's raining right now in Paris,
a warm drenching rain,
plummeting from the Parisian sky
upon the gardens where we'll walk
so soon
so soon
so soon that I can almost
but not quite grasp it
hold it in my outstretched hands
outstretched, held up to the dry, ungiving skies
waiting for the rain to fall
to soak my palms
to soak my face
to run down my back.

But I stand, still
with palms upraised, reaching, stretching,
yearning for the rain,
yearning for the qickening of the lightning.

Dear God, send the rain.
My parched, cracked skin
thirsts for the deluge
and for a hand to hold in mine
and another
to wipe the water from my eyes.
