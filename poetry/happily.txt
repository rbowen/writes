Happily Married
19-Apr-2007

On that chilly summer evening
I told her I was engaged
that it wasn't what I wanted,
but that it was what I was doing.
It was reality.
It was what was
supposed to be.

On that fall afternoon,
I told her I was in love,
that I didn't understand her,
didn't even like her all the time,
didn't know, for sure
what the hell I was doing,
but it was reality,
it was, somehow, destiny.

On the dusty road,
I told her that I didn't have a choice,
that I loved her,
but was going to marry another
One who didn't make me laugh,
didn't like my jokes,
didn't go on these drives with me,
didn't make me feel smart, handsome, fun.
But it was how things had turned out,
in spite of everything.

Over the crackle of the phone,
I told her that we were 
happily married,
although I hadn't been happy in years,
and what does it mean,
after all,
to be married,
if that's what we were?
Married to someone who didn't
understand the turtles,
thought the feather a waste of time,
hated the gecko,
and shunned the Big Blue Room.
She knew I was lying,
even if I didn't.

I told you I was miserable,
that I was divorced,
that I was sad, depressed, and deeply lonely.
I told you that you made me happy,
for the first time in ... who can remember?
I told you that my life wasn't perfect,
that I wasn't perfect,
that I was lost and afraid.
I told you that reality and destiny
hadn't really turned out much to my liking,
and that I chose to make a new reality.
And if reality doesn't cooperate,
well, at least
we have each other.
