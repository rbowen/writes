No Bears Are Out Tonight
07-Feb-2008

Running light-footed through the dark
the seven of us sing
"No bears are out tonight,"
fending off the bears
lurking in the deep, dark woods,
waiting, patiently, to catch

us unawares. A catch
in my voice, as something in the dark
rustles slightly, the woody
branch sways. I sing
out all the louder. No bear
was going to get me tonight.

"Daddy shot them all last night!"
I bellow, lifting the catch
on the gate. The bear
emerges from the shadow, its dark 
fur rippling in the starlight. I sing
out to the others. We run for the woods

at the end of the path. Our wooden
voices, stiff with fright, fill the night
with our screams of delight, the song
interrupted as terror and laughter catch
up with us, and we flee into the dark,
pursued by the fearsome bears.

Not immune to the moment, the bears
collapse in giggles at the wood's
edge, and we're swallowed by the dark,
surrounded by the African night.
The bear surveys his small catch,
the crickets scream out their song,

Those of us still kids begin to sing,
and those who are now bears
join in the chase, to catch
us, making our circles through the woods.
All around us, the warm night
and the enveloping velvet darkness.

We sing in the dark of the woods,
"No bears are out tonight, 
Daddy caught them all last night!"
