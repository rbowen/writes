Redemption
25-Apr-2007

The gate that I knew was closed,
like the Golden Gate of Jerusalem
never to be opened,
swings easily on its hinges and lets me pass,
like the Messiah into the Holy City.

The path that I knew was overgrown,
never to be cleared,
allows me to pass without so much as
wetting my toes.

The tree,
absolutely, irredeemably, unquestionably dead,
is covered with leaves,
looking quite proud of itself,
almost smug, in its new emerald shirt.

And, greatest miracle of all,
she who I knew didn't exist,
is waiting for me there,
carving her name
indelibly on my heart.
