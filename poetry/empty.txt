Empty house
07-May-2007

For all those years,
coming back to an empty home,
and that seemed ok.
Seemed - was - normal.
Welcomed only by the fish,
dead, as often as not,
and a trip out to the kennel to get the dog,
almost as pleased to see me as the dead fish.

Never again to have to come home
to an empty house,
seems almost a fantasy,
an absurd dream,
a hallucination.

Never again to come home to grass
too long.
And yet, I must tread carefully,
lest it cut my feet.
