At Sea
27-Jun-2007

Far out at sea I toss,
looking in vain for the shore.
I know it was there. I saw it. It was nearby.
But I have lost my bearings in the storm,
and wander, clinging to this splintered board,
which threatens to capsize any moment,
sending me to where the stars are but
faint pinpricks, far, far above,
a mocking reminder of what was.

And yet surely this is foolishness.
The shore was right there - I know it must be yet.
I need merely get turned the right way
and feel the firm sand beneath
my bleeding feet, and walk up to where
the other broken shells lay drying in the sun.

So I cling to the board, though it cuts my hands,
and I cling to the surety of the shore,
although I cannot see it above the salty breakers,
and I cling to the knowledge of the coming rescue,
less than a league away ... although in what direction,
I know not.
