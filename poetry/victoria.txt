From Victoria to Victoria
April 26, 2007

With the dirt of the Haven
still on my knees,
and rock dust still in my eyes,
I fly away from the sun
and towards its next rising.

Taking the Haven with me,
I go where you cannot come.

So strange to leave one joy
to go to another.
When I cross again,
you'll be by my side,
again going from one joy to another,
leaving Victoria Station,
going to Victoria Station.
