Whose woods these are I think I know.
His house is in the village though;
He will not see me stopping here
To watch his woods fill up with snow.
My little horse must think it queer
To stop without a farmhouse near
Between the woods and frozen lake
The darkest evening of the year.
He gives his harness bells a shake
To ask if there is some mistake.
The only other sound's the sweep
Of easy wind and downy flake.
The woods are lovely, dark and deep.
But I have promises to keep,
And miles to go before I sleep,
And miles to go before I sleep.


-------

Whose woods these are I do not care
But I must run to 'scape the bear.
He will not see me stopping here
To catch my breath, I briefly dare.

My little horse did think it odd
And now she lies there on the sod
The bear did make swift work of her
One gulp did send him to her god

And now I run, from oak to fir
The bear behind me, hear him grr!
I run, although I long for sleep
I run and run, my legs a blur.

The bear is huge, his roar is deep
But I have limbs I'd like to keep
And miles to go to reach my Jeep
Alas, I might not reach my Jeep.
