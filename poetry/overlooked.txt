Ten years overlooked,
this puddle of paradise
at the bottom of my land.

Our land, now.

Then, just me, clumsily
showing you what I wanted,
some day, for this oasis
to become.

You, not content
with waiting, started
in, right then, to clear
the deadwood, prune
the live, spruning the someday
brought my dream into the now.

Now, we sit watching
the fire, burning
in the midst of our haven,
wondering
how we ever managed

before we were us.
