Loud
2013/08/12

It's really, really loud
in here, everyone shouting
to be heard,
everyone saying, why
is it SO LOUD? Can they
turn it down a little?

Nobody actually asking,
because they don't want to
spoil the party.

Outside, steel, concrete.
Under the camellias
rain kisses the earth

Missing
2014/05/20

I miss you
like the sun,
illuminating what I see,
giving it meaning beyond just another city,
just another hotel.

I miss you
like air,
filling me, giving me
life,
running its fingers through my hair,
bringing the smell of the camellias.

I miss you
like fine wine,
the way you turn yet another meal
into a banquet
with my best friend.

I miss you.

Paris Sans Tu
2014-11-02

Au Pere Rousseau is shuttered
and I'm having a hard time finding
somewhere to eat. It's 15:00,
all of the kitchens
closed,

and they're telling me to come back later,
18:00, perhaps,
when they'll be serving again.

I grab a jambon avec fromage
at the boulangerie,
the proprietor more comfortable
in arabic than either French or English.
It's every bit as hearty, and tough,
as it looked in the window.

I lit a candle,
placed it at the feet of Therese,
listened to the mass, catching,
perhaps, half of it.

God be merciful to me,
a sinner.

Paris is, as always,
wonderful.
Different each time,
seen through different eyes.

Paris sans tu,
c'est triste.
Pas mauvais,
just lonelier,
different,

different memories,
and reluctant to make new ones
sans tu.

Mais,
Paris seulement,
c'est meme Paris,
non?
