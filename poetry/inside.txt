Inside
24-Mar-2007

Outside, it's colder than the
Sahara at night,
the tea turned gray and
the cups filling with sand.

Outside, it's colder than the
engine of your stolen car,
abandoned by the turnpike,
the faint aromas of your former life
fading, blending with the stench of
passing trucks
on their way to Vegas.

Outside,
it's raining,
a cold, unrepentant rain,
with no hint of Lake Nakuru.
A thousand rainy days,
and the umbrella is never big enough.

Inside, my head's a box of stars
I finally dare to open.
