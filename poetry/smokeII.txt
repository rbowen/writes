Smoke signals, take II
Nov 1, 2007

We send up a pillar of smoke,
a guide in this wilderness
of suburbia.

All around the masses watch
reality televions, having not encountered reality
in years.
They drink lite beer,
missing the full bodies wine
of the real world right beyond
their back porch.

From afar, others may see
our pillar of smoke,
even as they send up their own.
From the top of this tree,
or that one,
we might see one,
two,
a dozen pillars rising
and know that
we are not alone.
