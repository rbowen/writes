Time Is Money
15-May-2007

Important men
having important conversationd
determined that we all know
how important.

Calling to encourage you
to focus on what works,
rather than doing what doesn't work.

And that this eleventh hour deal
was big enough for me to
interrupt my busy schedule
of waiting for my delayed flight.
