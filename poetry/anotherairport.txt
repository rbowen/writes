Another Airport
07-May-2007
Schipol

Another airport,
another trip,
another week away from
home.

The next one,
will be the last
after which to come
home
to an empty bed.

So I sit with the 
same people
going to the
same places.
Different languages,
different paint on the tails of the planes,
but more of the same.
People not at home, wishing they were
and people anxious to get away from
whatever they call home.

Different, but also all the same.
Schipol, Detroit, Bluegrass.
But, at Bluegrass,
you are there waiting for me
and then I will really be
home.
