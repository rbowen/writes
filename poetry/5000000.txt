Act II, Scene 5,000,000
07-Aug-2007

Enter, stage left.

Like each time before,
I assert that this will be 
the last time I perform this part,
the last time I follow
someone else's script.
One of these times, I hope
to believe it.

The lines are written
in a juvenile hand
with no sense of poetry or
overarching plot, but only
a view to the quick laugh,
the applause of the audience,
and the sale of a few more tickets,
or perhaps just another bag of popcorn.

Yet I deliver them again,
woodenly and without feeling,
while promising myself I'll
write something better for next time.

Next time.

I'll make it through this
one last performance,
just this one,
then I'll wipe off the makeup,
the sweat of the floodlights,
and write the next scene
to be a little more believeable.

The playwright, cloaked in black,
peers, raven-like, from the wings,
rubs stained hands together gleefully,
and plans my next appearance.
