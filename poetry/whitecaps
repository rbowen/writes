Whitecaps
Aug 1 2007

While the waves wash
around me, I sit, secure
in the calm of the haven.
The waves are not always
destructive and cold,
not always the harbingers of pain.
Often the same wave can
hold balm and harm,
injury and its salve.
So strange, always, to have
the raven and the songbird
skimming the same whitecaps.
