Shit and Lace
22-May-2007

In life, as in decor,
everything of true beauty
must be covered
in frillies and lace, puppies and kittens,
so that the true beauty 
never has a chance to be seen.
For true beauty takes discernment
and patience,
and hard work.

Or, again, often as not,
the true beauty must be shat upon
so that if you can't understand it,
nobody else has the opportunity
to show you up.

And, again, as often as not,
when you can't decide,
you settle for doing both.
Shit on it, and cover it
in a delicate lace doilie.
