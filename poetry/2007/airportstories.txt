Airport Stories

Detroit Airport

A million lives, interestection for a moment and
moving on.
Each story as complex as my own,
but I'll never see more than
this moment.

If I pause, and share
more than a moment with you,
do all these other stories find a story
with which to intersect for
more than a moment?

You are so far away,
at this moment sharing other stories,
as they see
just a moment
of yours.
Our stories go on,
inextricably intertwined now,
every moment
now a part of one another.

And the crowd moves on,
down the moving sidewalk ...
that on to Paris,
that to Chicago,
and that one heading home
back to the others in their story.
