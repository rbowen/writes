The Hell
(For Abigail Beatrix)
06:30, 1-March-2007

One assumes that God knows what
the Hell He is doing.
One assumes He knows what
The Hell does to us.

One may believe that
Good may come from The Hell
without believing that
The Hell was willed for Good.

One cannot pretend to a mother
that Good was willed
in the passing of a Father's Joy 
and the Bringer of that Joy




Unless the Lord watch
29-March-2007

Mzee took it quite to heart - 
to stay awake was in vain.
He looked so peaceful, too,
sure in his knowledge 
that the Lord watched the house.

Each night, the Lord watched,
and Mzee slept,
but not in vain.
And we, too, slept
fearless
with peaceful dreams
even knowing that Mzee slept as well as we did

For we knew
Unless the Lord watch the house
the watchman sleepeth in vain
and if Mzee felt safe,
we, too, must be.





Psalms
3-4 am, Holy Saturday
7-4-07

Last night in the valley
it was so cold,
so dark in the
shadow of death.

So silent, but for
the voice of David
telling me to
fear no evil.

Before me comes
thy rod and thy staff,
Christopher,
comforting me,
reminding me to
Praise the Lord!
His mercy does, indeed
endure forever.

And surely
goodness and mercy follows me;
Leslie reminds me that
my enemies cannot harm me
for you, oh Lord
are with me.

I fear evil
as I leave my dwelling place.
I do fear.
But I know that you are with me.






The Penitent St. Peter

My Lord and friend,
what have I done?
It is insufficient to say ...
anything.
My sin is ever before me,
and my betrayal fills my thoughts,
day and night.
I cannot even try to atone.
Lord Jesus Christ,
have mercy on me,
a sinner.





As God Forgives
October 14, 2007

Can I ever forgive you
as God forgives us all?
Even you, good, kind,
compassionate man
who bows humbly to me
and begs me, your brother.
to forgive you,
Yet I promise,
on cue, but also heartfelt,
that I do, indeed, forgive you
as God forgives us all.

No small thing, this pledge,
not undertaken casually.
An almost overwhelming burden,
if taken honestly.

For if I forgive
as God forgives us all,
need I not also forgive all,
as God forgives?





As Incense
17-Oct-2007

prayer rises as incense
incense as prayer

smoke catches the light
filtering through the windows
light that is only seen
when it strikes the smoke.

the light 
from the face of God
is seen only when it encounters
our prayers rising through
the mists that cloud our days

and every now and then
sparks leap up from the incense
with an urgency that cannot be stilled
crying out to God
and burning holes in the carpet



Sycamore
26-May-2007

They say that the sycamore remembers,
and sheds its bark to honor Zaccheus,
and his ardor for his Lord.

They say that the donkey remembers too,
and bears the cross on his back as a reminder
of the hosannahs and palms,
the cloaks he walked upon,
and the King he carried.

They say that the wait-a-bit bleeds red,
when it remembers that it was placed on His head.

And that the fig tree withers in the sun,
with the memory of His words.

Lord, have mercy on me,
I am so forgetful.
