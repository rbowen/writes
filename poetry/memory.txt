Memory
26-Mar-2007

My dirty brown cat returned yesterday.
I didn't even remember I had a cat.
I don't even like cats.

Filthy and flea-ridden, she brushed against my leg,
asking me to remember her,
asking me for something to feed
her insatiable hunger.

I'd like to forget her again,
dispose of her quietly,
forget that I once loved her.

I had turned the couch pillow the other way,
to forget how she shredded it.
I had convinced myself
that the scratches on the table leg
were from something else.

And what about the favorite wine glass,
knocked over, spilling the favorite petite sirah.
That's harder to forget,
with the purple bruise still there on the carpet.
