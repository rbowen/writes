The Hell
(For Abigail Beatrix)
06:30, 1-March-2007

One assumes that God knows what
the Hell He is doing.
One assumes He knows what
The Hell does to us.

One may believe that
Good may come from The Hell
without believing that
The Hell was willed for Good.

One cannot pretend to a mother
that Good was willed
in the passing of a Father's Joy 
and the Bringer of that Joy
