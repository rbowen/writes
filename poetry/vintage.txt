Vintage, 2007
20-Jun-2007

A very good year,
with a long, long growing season
and hot summer.
In fact, the growing season perhaps
a little too long.
The rains came late,
but when they came, boy did they come!
The storms, too, were fierce,
but, still a good growing season.

Plenty of tannins --
someone inexperienced may consider it tart,
even bitter,
but an experienced taster will recognize this
as a sign of a long life to come,
and many, many years of quality aging
improving each year, indefinitely.

A mouth full of soil, smoke, and flowers,
The smoke of summer bonfires, 
with a hint of toasted marshmallow,
and freshly tilled earth, with a hint of grass.
Flowers! So many flowers. A mouthful of flowers -
dandelions and poppies.

A long finish, lingering sweetly for so long
that the next sip seems almost an interruption.

A truly heady wine, this vintage,
hard to put down,
rare as a snowflake in summer,
rare as tears in Paris,
so plentiful that we can share it with all who wish,
so precious that we may just keep it
all for ourselves.
