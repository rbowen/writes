The possibility of a coming summer
2-March-2007

Could it be that the sky was 
always this beautiful,
with Azure and Slate so intermixed
that they were
impossible to separate?

The sky had been a dull muddy slate
for so long
that I had stopped looking
stopped marveling
stopped believing in the Azure
in the possibility of a coming summer.
