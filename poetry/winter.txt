Sunrise over Maasai Mara
06-Mar-2007

My African soul,
muffled in mittens and scarves,
has almost endured the winter.

Someone told me that
I had imagined the African sun.
Or, anyways, if I hadn't,
it would be better to pretend that I had.
After all,
reality is more important 
than your Puddleglumesque fantasies.

But, I can hear the robins
(or are those superb starlings?)
and I see the sun coming up through the pines
(or are those acacias?)
and I begin to wonder if 
it wasn't the winter that was imaginary.

There's still a few more leagues
to walk through the snow
but at least I'm not alone
and at least you can see
the sun rising over the Mara
through my eyes.
