Patchwork

Somewhere over fly-over country

A patchwork quilt,
as far as I can see.
Browns, with but a few greens.
Mostly ploughed,
soaking up the spring rains,
and waiting,
longing for summer.

The creeks and streams
snake across the fields,
leaving trails of glittering silver,
and towering trees,
clad in their emerald coats.

Somewhere down in there,
a quiet haven,
where someone waits for someone
on their way home.
