Mombasa
26-May-2007

I stand at the edge of the world and look out,
out on the endless deeps stretching to the east.
Out of forever, the sun leaps from the ocean
and rushes towards me.

Already warm beneath my feet, sand stretches to my right and left,
unbroken from here to Shaka's land that way,
and to Arabia that way,
white sands, seaweed, and dhows, riding the quiet waves,
untouched by the passing years.

I could stand here forever, and would, if I knew
what was coming in the years ahead. I'd stay,
gaze out to the edge of the world,
and never dream of sailing there,
never wish to leave the white sands,
soft hushing of quiet tides,
singing of Giriama men on the way to their boats.

Frantic turmoil, upheaval, hatred and politics,
so very, very far away, as I work my toes into the sand,
and watch ghost crabs skitter across driftwood,
and into their holes.

A deep breath, and the world moves on.
Mombasa remains the same, but I choose to
move on with the world, and am forever changed.
