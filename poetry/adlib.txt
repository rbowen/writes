Breaking from the script,
I begin to improvise --
taking the plot whither I will 
without regard to the will of the playwright.

Immediately, I'm astonished to discover that
the playwright was an impostor, a usurper.
It only worked as long as I played along,
but now I see the unravelled plot-lines,
the loose ends cleverly concealed behind props,
the props themselves held up by gaffer tape and idle actors.

The plot, left to itself, develops
more in line with sense and reason,
and the stars are allowed to be the stars,
without being upstaged by the stagehands.

The danger, and also the payoff, is that
everyone starts to improvise, and things are unpredictable,
chaotic, one might say unscripted,
and the stagehands lose control.
But it's a control they should never have had.

The dialogue is less polished, if less forced,
the metaphors too, perhaps a little less forced,
unlike this one,
and the segue from one scene to the next
choppier
more like

real life.
