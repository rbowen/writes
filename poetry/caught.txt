Caught in the rain
08-Jun-2007

Caught in the
torrential burst from the heavens,
drenching the earth
sluicing away the scum, dust, and fallen leaves.
Soaking me to the skin,
running down my back,
down my face, down my beard
like oil down the beard of Aaron,
blessing me, washing me clean.

Gone as quickly as it came,
I almost missed it,
almost cowered inside to watch it pass me by,
almost missed the blessing.
