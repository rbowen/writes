Climbing Longonot
31-Jan-2008

We drive up out of the plain,
rising from the dust and heat
into the infinite sky, the beat
of the engine keeping time
with my heart. The colors drain

from the world, grass turns pale lime,
the rocks from purple-black to gray.
And now, the wind begins to play
on our faces as we rise, high
into the clouds, out of the grime.

From up here, the limitless azure sky
stretches the length of the Rift.
Far below, pufs of dust drift
away lazily, the herd on the move.
I would gladly remain up here, die

up here. Hard to leave once you've
tasted these heights, drunk a draught
of the pre heavens, laughed
with friends until it hurt, lain
on your back and gazed as the clouds stream by.
