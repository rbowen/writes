We
24-May-2007

We have reached a point where
I am never quite certain where
we begin and
I end.

I am content to say that
we think a particular thing when
I know that
we have agreed to what
I am asserting.

We are one and
I am two and
we are not distinct from what
I am. But, at the same time,

we can still be two, so that
I am me, you are you, and
we are still one.
I am content to hold this mystery, lightly.

We are.
I am, because
We are.
