Tunnel Vision
01-Jun-2007

Avoiding the obvious cliche,
walking towards the light.
In the darkness, but aware of light illuminating
my face and outstretched hands, blinding just a little
if directly gazed upon.

So many years in the tunnel, forgetting 
that it's a tunnel,
forgetting that the sky doesn't look like that,
and that stars weren't invented by Edison.

Step just so far between one tie and the next,
the rails are just so far apart,
keep the step, don't vary the stride, or risk
breaking a toe, perhaps a leg.
I hear that outside the tunnel you can
run zigzag through the grass
or lay on your back, and just watch
clouds roll by

hour

after hour.
