There will be flowers
31-3-07

Surely there will be 
a great many flowers

Poppies,
to help me forget.
There is so much to forget.
And poppies also
to mourn the death of
so many bright things.

But many more roses,
a profusion of roses,
a riot of roses.
Wild roses,
untended and allowed to spread their
beauty and thorns
whither they will.
