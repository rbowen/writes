Stolen Nutella

If I have to tell one more person what Nutella is,
I might start believing that I imagined it.
To have experienced a whole different reality
from so many I encounter, is, at times,
unnerving, and more than a little unbalancing.

And yet, under the Parisian sky,
you are stealing Nutella,
unabashed, slathering it on a bagette,
and savoring every sweet purloined mouthful.

You are something of a plumb line,
recentering my vertiginous world,
stilling the spinning,
a windbreak for the typhoon.

The unexpected blend of El Paso, Soeul and Paris,
not unlike my own peculiar melange,
your sophistication set off with just the perfect touch of -
dare I even say it? - redneck,
makes me feel, finally, that I am not,
always and everywhere,
quite such a foreigner.
