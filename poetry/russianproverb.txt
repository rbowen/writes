Russian Proverb
14-Feb-2008

The light spills welcomingly from the
Church at the end of the lane. My heart
Is strangely moved to stop in.
Close upon the heels of this, business intrudes,
But a moment with God, in
The peace of His holy place, turns my
Road towards the door. My soul
Is warmed, strengthened against the
Icy blasts of life.

The road then leads past the 
Pub, the den of iniquity towards which my heart
Is also strongly drawn,
Far I am
But a man, and prone to stumble.
I enjoy the company of a friend, of a pint, and I
Will inevitably be led astray.
Walk with me, hold my hand as we
Carefully navigate this treacherous road.
