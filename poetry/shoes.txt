These Shoes
13-Jun-2007

These shoes will walk down Champs Elysees with you,
climb to the top of the Eiffel Tower,
stand in front of La Giaconde,
and walk the steps of Sacre Coeur.

They'll stand in Westminster Abbey with you,
cross Westminster Bridge, stand in Victoria Station,
and run down the up escalater in Harrods.

Then, they'll walk across the exotic Newark airport,
and then Bluegrass, and then home,
where they will carry me down to the Haven,
with you, and I will be home,
at last.
