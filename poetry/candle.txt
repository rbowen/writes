Candle
28-May-2007

Much light produces many shadows.
Too much light, it is true, just blinds us,
and the shadows are hidden by the glare.
But the right amount of light,
held the right distance from the eyes,
shows the shadows starkly.

We sit close in the candle light,
flickering quietly between us,
lighting your face,
your beautiful face.
As long as I gaze upon your face,
your beautiful face,
the shadows are revealed as insubstantial,
fleeting things
that will never stand up
to even the gentlest candle.
