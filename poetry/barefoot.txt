Barefoot
24/02/2007

With the coming of summer
I want to take off my iron-soled shoes
and put on my cream-sponge para litefoot shoes

no

I want to be married barefoot

To take off the whole armor
the helmet that deafens
the breastplate that protects the heart
the greaves of grief
and the iron shoes of preparedness

and be barefoot

To enter the nave unprotected
unprepared
and feel the spirit against my skin

To feel every texture
feel the weave of live
experience life squishing betwen my toes

To lay down the shield, in faith
be left with only the blade
and approaching the dragon
unarmed
rather than slaying her
embrace her.
