Untitled
01-Jun-2007

Untitled,
unwritten,
undecided and unknown,
at least by you.

The next chapter still in the pen,
the next poem still a spark in my eye.
If I choose to pause here, I will, and
you shall not direct the plot to go that way
if I choose for it to go this way.

You are not the editor,
I do not wish for you to even be a reader.
You may look at the cover in the book store window,
and regret not knowing me.
Perhaps as much as 
I regret ever knowing you.
