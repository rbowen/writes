Missing the parade
27-Jun-2007

Sitting alone in the school room,
working this last troublesome equation,
while two streets over I hear the parade beginning.
The sirens wind up, and the horses whinney,
and out the window I see a few first test bursts
of fireworks, high over the rooftops.

The marching band starts to tune up,
a dreadful cacophony, and 
a few bars of Eye of the Tiger,
and the Shriners rev their tinny engines.

The train leaves Denver and the other leaves Chicago,
and somewhere, someone wants to know how fast
something or other ... and who really cares?

And the dogs are barking, and kids screaming and laughing
and crying and calling to one another.
Mothers call to their kids, and kids call to their dogs
and the dogs yip and bark in a veritable frenzy.

I don't know what I did, or who said it was me,
but here I am, and I must do this before I can
leave for the parade, the parade that is
starting without me. Leaving down the street,
and I can't find the answer, and the trains seem
to have taken a siding somewhere, and I can't find them either.

But I sense that the teacher is looking out the window, too,
and she wants to go to the parade, and maybe,
just maybe, if I ask real nice, and smile real sweet,
she'll let me finish this
some other time.
