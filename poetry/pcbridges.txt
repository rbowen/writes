Peace Corps Bridges
24-May-2007

They called them
Peace Corps Bridges,
built by well-meaning foreigners
in a time of drought.
There was no water in the rivers,
and so no need for a flow way,
just a road across the dry ditch.

So they did
the best they knew how,
building bridges all along the road
from Bujumbura to the border,
and from there to the lake.

The foreigners went home,
and the beneficiaries shook their heads sadly,
knowing what was to come next.

We drove the roads in the rain,
the water sluicing across the top of the bridge,
which was now a dam.

The beneficiaries laughed sadly,
their lives, as usual,
made harder by the kindness of strangers,
strangers who knew better,
and would not listen to the
ignorant natives,
clearly desperate for their assistance,
but making foolish claims about
rains that only come
every five years.
