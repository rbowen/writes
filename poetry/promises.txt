Broken promises
30-May-2007

Only through rain can the light be prismated,
turning the mundane into a sky full of jewels.
But I do love the mundane, and would gladly exchange
the diamonds for the sand.

Only through pain can we find the value of love,
the furnace of disappointment turning the sand into glass,
glass only to be broken, smashed, ground to sand again,
expiating our rage, as well as inflaming it.

Only through betrayal are promises shown as gold,
the rainbow, once followed, leads nowhere, and must be
retraced, to find its source in the rain.

Again and again, the promise is offered in the east,
broken in the west,
Insubstantial, ephemeral, almost invisible,
impossibly far away, yet also right here,
in the palm of my hand,
sparkling in the diamond, this shard of glass,
all that remains of a broken promise.
