Leaf
07-Nov-2007

Poised in this one leaf,
autumn pauses for just a moment
holding its palate, here, with a splash red,
and a slash of the brightest greens,
undecided between summer's warmth
and the winter's bitter wind.

As it whips around my legs, the wind
invites me to pluck a leaf
with its reminders of the warmth
and quickly, too, there's just a few moments
before the spring's green
gives up to bleed a rosy red.

And so, my face burned red
by the icy wind
I reached up into the green
and pulled down this leaf,
as if by this, I can extend the momentarily
lingering summer warmth.

Even as I pluck it, the warm
rays of the november sun blaze down red,
reminding me of the time
spent roaming the winding
roads of Paris, and of another leaf
plucked on another far-away green.
