The Oven Bird
Robert Frost

There is a singer everyone has heard,
Loud, a mid-summer and a mid-wood bird,
Who makes the solid tree trunks sound again.
He says that leaves are old and that for flowers
Mid-summer is to spring as one to ten.
He says the early petal-fall is past
When pear and cherry bloom went down in showers
On sunny days a moment overcast;
And comes that other fall we name the fall.
He says the highway dust is over all.
The bird would cease and be as other birds
But that he knows in singing not to sing.
The question that he frames in all but words
Is what to make of a diminished thing. 


American Idol

There is a singer everyone has heard,
Last night at nine, she came in third,
Who makes the teeth grind and ears bleed,
And yet earns the judges' accolades
Because she made them laugh 'til they peed.
She claims, now, that she's a great star
And seeks record contracts and parades,
While those who watched and listened are,
One and all, astonished at her inability
To carry a tune, or display an ounce of humility.
We wish she would cease, and be silent as a stone
And that she would realize we'd had our fill.
The question that I ask, and not alone,
Is what to make of her lack of skill.
