I (Unfinished)
24-May-2007

I am,
as Walt has said,
the sum of my component parts,
those parts being all those
who share my breath.

And so, my song of myself
cannot help but be the song of us.
Many men are islands, but
all islands have waves
that lap up on them,
and ravens the fly over them.

So much better to be
a part of the main land,
connected by some bridge or another.

Granted, one runs the risk of
building the wrong bridge,
and the occasional bridge
washes out, sinks into the swamp,
or burns brightly
consuming itself, and often,
many of those who walk on it.

We each walk on another's bridges,
we each breathe another's air,
and we each cause another's pain,
I, certainly, not least of all.
