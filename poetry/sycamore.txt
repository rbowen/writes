Sycamore
26-May-2007

They say that the sycamore remembers,
and sheds its bark to honor Zaccheus,
and his ardour for his Lord.

They say that the donkey remembers too,
and bears the cross on his back as a reminder
of the hosannahs and palms,
the cloaks he walked upon,
and the King he carried.

They say that the wait-a-bit bleeds red,
when it remembers that it was placed on His head.

And that the fig tree withers in the sun,
with the memory of His words.

Lord, have mercy on me,
I am so forgetful.
