Paths
23-Aug-2007

Two roads diverged in a wood, and I,
confused by the darkness,
plunged headlong into the brush,
towards the foxfire in the distance.
With dawn came realization, but,
thinking it was too late,
I pressed resolutely on,
though the glow had disappeared
with the coming of light.

And even when signposts
declared the way back to the high road
I dared not admit to being lost.

For even on the road to Hell,
one has one's pride,
and, besides, to admit to being lost
would be to admit to being misled,
to being a fool,
to give in to despair.

But, one day, on this same road to Hell,
I saw again the foxfire
so long forgotten, so long dismissed
as an illusory fancy of foolish youth.
There it was, the light
coming from unlikely and impossible sources,
falling on eyes which knew it to be
a myth.

Not believing, I dared to believe

and once again struck out
into the tangle,
hoping for that which I
knew not to exist.

There, mere paces from me
through the wood
lay the Path, lit by the
improbable foxfire --
that which -- I have on good authority --
does not exist.

Newly stumbled from the wood,
my fellow-traveller greeted me,
known to my heart, but
a stranger to my eyes.

Now we move down that path,
forsaken so many
ages and ages ago,
with little hope that we
should ever come back.
Together, as one,
never quite believing in the light
yet, too, frightened to stray from it.

Not believing
we have no hope
but to believe.
