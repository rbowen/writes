Clearing the land
31-3-07

I am so sore
from the toil
it took to reach this point.

It seems it would have been 
easier then.
So easy to take a few steps
down the slope towards me.
Or was there already
dead wood about which
I knew nothing
smothering all the potential growth?

Perhaps, at the end,
it was easier to pretend
the potential beauty 
wasn't even there.

But now!
The green can't hold itself back any longer!
Leaning over the fence
beckoning
come and play!
