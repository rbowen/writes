Paying the tab
08-Nov-2007

Wishing to drink deeply
I take
instead
these
short sips.
Delicious,
but unsatisfying.

Wanting an enormous tumbler
or to drink directly from the spring
newly found, bubbling up in the Haven
instead
it comes
in these
tiny
shot glasses.

And between then, I wait, interminably
for refils
while the waiter checks to see
if my credit is good.
