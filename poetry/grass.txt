Grass
26-Apr-2007

Unless a seed fall to the ground
and die,
and be beaten down
into the ground,
and drowned,
and abandoned to despair,
and forgotten, left for dead, given up for lost,

it will remain only a seed.

The tiny emerald fingers
pushing up through the ground,
reach for the sky,
impatiently pushing aside
the dark earth,
watered by the almost-summer warm rain.

Will I ever come to expect
these surprises?
the redemption among the barrenness,
the irrepressible rebirth amidst the
lingering decay of winter.
