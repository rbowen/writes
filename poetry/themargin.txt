The Margin is Insufficient
11-Mar-2007

I've long assumed that
Fermat had nothing -
no "truly marvelous demonstration"
for which the margin was too narrow.

But suppose he did.

When all you have is the margin,
there's never sufficient space.
The margin is insufficient to express
ideas that the universe cannot contain.

We spend so much time
living in the margin
frantically jotting notes to each other,
unable or 
unwilling to take the time
to fully express the
truly marvelous demonstration
on the page.

The margin is insufficient
for what I want to tell you.
I need the whole page, the whole book,
a library.
And years in which to sit undisturbed
and read to you.
