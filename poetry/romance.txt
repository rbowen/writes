Romance
-------

You asked what 'romance' means,
a word dilited by bad books and worse movies,
lacy cards, lacy underthings, and candy
with pointless slogans
more about lust than love.

Romance:
a feeling of excitement and mystery associated with love

Excitement, yes.

But mystery?
Possibly the mystery of what new discovery
will come tomorrow, next week, next year.
That's life, though.
Life is full of mystery.

Love, not really so mysterious.
It is no mystery that I love you.

Possibly a mystery that we found one another,
given the vagaries of life,
and the foolish choices we each made getting here,
that we should meet at that rare cusp of a moment,
and fall into step together.

But is that 'romance'?

Romance:
a quality or feeling of mystery, excitement,
and remoteness from everyday life.

Nothing could be further from reality.
Every day life is where it's at.
Romance is in washing the dishes,
putting up insulation,
cutting the underbrush,
changing the diapers.

Ok, not that last one.

Remoteless from everyday life is all well and good
once in a while,
but if it's all Paris,
and never Lexington,
what's the point.

No, my love,
it appears that we are not romantics.
We are stodgy,
practical,
and boring,

in an exciting, mysterious sort of way.
