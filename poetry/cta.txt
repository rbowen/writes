CTA to Monroe
5-17-07

Riding the CTA
one feels, continuously,
the terror of having boarded
the wrong train,
in the wrong direction,
and the assurance
of never getting back to
a known place.

So much better
to ride with you,
to know that even if we
are lost
we would be lost together.

Monroe is not Victoria
but when you are with me,
all places are Victoria.
