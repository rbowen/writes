Silence
Summer 1986, Mt. Kenya
15-Mar-2007

Surrounded every day by the
sounds of civilization,
the roar of engines
the whisper of fans
the beeps of phones
and behind everything, 
the ubiquitous thrum of unseen motors,
it's hard to imagine

silence.

Standing high above the treeline
9 of us,
from 6 different countries
headed for such different destinations,
shared a moment of

silence.

Not a whisper, or roar, or beep.
Not a breath of wind.

Silence:

A music so beautiful,
that it cannot be recorded,
and so rare
that one must go to the ends of the earth
to seek it.
