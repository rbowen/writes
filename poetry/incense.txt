As incense
17-Oct-2007

prayer rises as incense
incense as prayer

smoke catches the light
filtering through the windows
light that is only seen
when it strikes the smoke.

the light 
from the face of God
is seen only when it encounters
our prayers rising through
the mists that cloud our days

and every now and then
sparks leap up from the incense
with an urgency that cannot be stilled
crying out to God
and burning holes in the carpet
