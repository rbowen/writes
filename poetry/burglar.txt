Invited
07-Jun-2007

Having invited the burglar into our home
we sit and watch the plunder.
Not quite helpless, not quite astonished.
After all, I extended the invitation.

We watch as my 
precious things are bruised,
broken, crushed,
or ignored completely as irrelevant, 
while a lacy trinket is ogled.

Drinking from a favorite bottle of petite sirah,
muddy boots resting on books on the table,
the burglar looks in astonishment when asked to leave.
After all, I extended the invitation.
