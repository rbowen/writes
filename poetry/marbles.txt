Marbles
20-Jun-2007

As an analogy, it hardly works - 
but then, when do they?

Yes, the passage of time is hard,
so very hard,
teaching us that the games we played as children
aren't games any more. The things we laughed at
are now so very serious,
the harmless jibes now cut to the bone,
leave us gasping for breath as time,
so very hard
rolls by inexorably, the stone of Sisyphus,
rolling on, crushing whoever gets in the way.

And, certainly, each passing moment has
embedded deep within it,
colorful mysteries,
blades of grass, captured, protected from the
pecking of ravens,
hidden away, never to be fully revealed
though we gaze deeply into those green orbs
for all eternity
there will always be more to see.

Perhaps time is a glass
that magnifies while it distorts,
distorts while it focuses the light into
a few bright pinpoints which
burn as they illuminate.
Yes, perhaps we can see what we would not have
once the marble has rolled past,
if we only take the time to look.

But all good analogies
are just analogies,
and not the real thing.
A jar of marbles, having served us well
will sit and collect dust,
year after year,
while the real thing draws us
further in, and further up,
long after the last marble
rolls down the neck of the bottle.
