Observation Lounge
15-May-2007

We used to sit
up in the observation lounge
you and me
and watch the planes come in
from exotic places
and leave for places
we wished we were going
Anywhere but here.

But here we were
and here just kept getting worse.

And those bad men
flew planes into stuff
and even the window into the exotic
was closed to us.

My precious angel,
I want to show you the world,
I want you to see all the places
that you can't go
because of how much
your world has changed.

I want to tell you
convince you
that it wasn't my fault it changed,
but what does that help?
You will grow up in a world
where the windows are boarded up.

Together, we will make our own windows,
even if it means tearing down a few boards.

And, at the same time,
we'll keep making here a better place
to come home to
when we're done looking.
