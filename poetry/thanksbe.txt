Thanks be to God
27-Feb-2007

I thought I would miss the hymns
And I do
I miss Come Thou Almighty King
and Great is They Faithfulness
and Through Gates of Splendor

But I find myself humming
For His Mercy Endureth Forever, Aleluia!
in the shower

And I miss
The Word of the Lord
(Thanks be to God)

And I miss
The Blood of Christ
(And the Cup of Salvation)

But
Thanks be to God
For He is good
His mercy endureth forever
Aleluia.
