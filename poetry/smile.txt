The Smile - La Giaconde
31-May-2007

July, 2007

I'll sit with you
on the floor in front of her
and look at her smile,
as the annoyed tourists stream past
with their disposable cameras
screaming kids
garish hats
and maps of the must-see attractions. 

She is as bemused as we:
with so much time ahead of us
why the hurry?
So we sit, and gaze at her -- 
she smiles on us
as she has smiled on so many lovers.

Time pauses 
for us, our story unfolding
moment by moment writing a record on our
memories. Eternally
etched for tomorrow's "Do you remember when ... ?"
