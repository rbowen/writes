Writing Frenzy
07-May-2007

The shark circles the wounded metaphor
darting in for a bite and
darting back out with its torn and ragged snack.

The blood boils into the water,
and others gather,
eager to get their sound bite in.

The metaphor, long dead,
floats listlessly,
allowing itself to be toyed with,
regurgitated, and redevoured.

The shark hangs back, 
wishing for a trifle more blood,
but, in the end,
settles for carrion.
