The rain lashes down in ragged sweeping combers that invade every crack and alley and sweep down the road with the arrogance of the marching troops of Jihad.
The dim lamp is the candle on my desk in the blackouts of another time, another place.
The music is also from that excerpt. 
The skies foretell the death of another Caesar, and the streetlights wink out for the midnight dawn.
In celebration of the demise of the immortal summer, the heavens scream and weep.
